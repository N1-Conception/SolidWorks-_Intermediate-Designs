This project features the 3D modeling of an Anchor Bracket designed using SolidWorks. the design created is fully defined. The bracket includes structural features like:
>A slotted hole for adjustable mounting
>A cylindrical hinge mount with a hole for fasteners
>Rounded edges and fillets for stress reduction

Key Design Highlights:

>Designed for mechanical assemblies requiring pivot or anchor points
>Focus on manufacturability and strength
>Suitable for applications where adjustable positioning is necessary
