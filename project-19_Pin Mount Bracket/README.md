# Bracket with Rib Support and Boss Mount 

This repository contains a parametric 3D model of a mechanical bracket featuring a cylindrical boss, rib reinforcement, and mounting base. The component is designed for structural applications requiring rotational shafts or pin support along with mounting stability.

## Key Features

- *Cylindrical Boss*: Suitable for shaft, pin, or bushing insertion.

- *Rib Reinforcement*: Enhances strength and rigidity against bending loads.

- *Mounting Base*: Provides holes for bolting the bracket to a surface or frame.

- *Machinable Geometry*: Suitable for 3D printing, CNC machining, or casting.

- Fully parametric and editable SolidWorks file
